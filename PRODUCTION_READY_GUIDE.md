# Create-A-Date Production Setup Guide

## Production Environment Status: READY

### Current Production Setup
All production components are configured and ready:

1. **Data Storage**: NeonDB (PostgreSQL)
   - All data is stored in a secure, scalable NeonDB instance.

2. **Security**:
   - Secure SSL connection to the database.
   - CORS policy restricted to the production domain.
   - HTTPS Only for the application.

3. **Environment Variables**: 
   All configured in `netlify.toml` and managed in the Netlify UI for:
   - Production
   - Deploy Preview
   - Branch Deploy

### Deployment

1. **Push to the main branch**.
2. Netlify automatically:
   - Builds the application with production environment variables.
   - Deploys to your production domain.
   - Enforces the configured CORS policy.

### Verify Production

1. Visit your production URL.
2. Core features should be fully functional:
   - User profiles
   - Date posts
   - Messaging

### Security & Monitoring

- Database access is controlled via a secure connection string.
- API usage can be monitored through Netlify's function logs.
- Error logging is configured in the `data-api` Netlify function.

Your app is production-ready. Just deploy.

## Troubleshooting

### "No users available yet" or other data issues
- **Database Not Seeded**: Ensure you have run the `direct-db-setup.sql` script on your NeonDB instance.
- **Incorrect Environment Variable**: Double-check that the `NEON_DATABASE_URL` is correctly set in your Netlify project settings.

### Function errors in logs
- **Database Connection Issues**: Verify that your NeonDB instance is running and accessible. Check for any IP allow lists or firewall rules.
- **Invalid API Action**: Check the browser's network tab to ensure the frontend is sending a valid action to the `data-api` function.

### PayPal issues
- **Incorrect Credentials**: Verify that `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` are the correct production values in your Netlify environment variables.
- **Server-Side Verification**: Remember that payment verification happens in a serverless function before premium access is granted.

## File Reference

- `direct-db-setup.sql` - The single source of truth for your database schema and seed data.
- `netlify.toml` - Build and environment configuration for all deployment contexts.
- `services/api.ts` - The frontend's API layer that communicates with the backend.
- `netlify/functions/data-api.ts` - The backend serverless function that handles all database operations.
